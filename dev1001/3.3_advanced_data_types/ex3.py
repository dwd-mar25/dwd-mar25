# Sets Exercise

required_skills = {"python", "git", "problem-solving"}
candidate_skills = {"python", "java", "communication"}

# Given the above sets, write code to:
# 1. Add "communication" to required_skills if it's not already there.
required_skills.add('communication')
print(required_skills)
# 2. Find out which skills the candidate has that are also required.
print(required_skills & candidate_skills)
# 3. Find out all unique skills possessed by either (required or candidate).
print(required_skills | candidate_skills)
# 4. Which skills are required but the candidate doesn't have.
# Difference
print(required_skills - candidate_skills)
